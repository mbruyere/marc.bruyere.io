 abstract = {In this short paper, we report on our experience setting up a monthly reading group around the socio-technical challenges and ethics of computer science and digitalization. Our reading group is the result of an encounter between four computer scientists with different backgrounds and career paths, who work in different areas of computer systems, and who live in different places. Beyond these factual differences, we share an eagerness to talk with our peers not only about our technical contributions to digital developments but also about their implications on the future of our societies.},
