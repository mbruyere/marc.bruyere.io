abstract: The Internet eXchange Points (IXP) are essential for the Internet evolution
  as they empower high bandwidth low latency and inexpensive local trafﬁc peering
  as opposed to transit trafﬁc. On the other side, Software Deﬁned Networking, or
  SDN for short (and its pre-dominant realization, the OpenFlow protocol) enables
  more dynamic network programmability to control network behaviour via open interfaces,
  as opposed to the legacy closed-box solutions and proprietary-deﬁned interfaces.
