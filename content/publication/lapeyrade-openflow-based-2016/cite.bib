 abstract = {The Internet eXchange Points (IXP) are essential for the Internet evolution as they empower high bandwidth low latency and inexpensive local trafﬁc peering as opposed to transit trafﬁc. On the other side, Software Deﬁned Networking, or SDN for short (and its pre-dominant realization, the OpenFlow protocol) enables more dynamic network programmability to control network behaviour via open interfaces, as opposed to the legacy closed-box solutions and proprietary-deﬁned interfaces.},
