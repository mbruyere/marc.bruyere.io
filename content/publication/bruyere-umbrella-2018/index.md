abstract: Software Defined internet eXchange Points (SDXs) are a promising solution
  to the long-standing limitations and problems of interdomain routing. While proposed
  SDX architectures have improved the scalability of the control plane, these solutions
  have ignored the underlying fabric upon which they should be deployed. This work
  makes the case for a new fabric architecture that proposes stronger control and
  data plane separation.
