 abstract = {Software Defined internet eXchange Points (SDXs) are a promising solution to the long-standing limitations and problems of interdomain routing. While proposed SDX architectures have improved the scalability of the control plane, these solutions have ignored the underlying fabric upon which they should be deployed. This work makes the case for a new fabric architecture that proposes stronger control and data plane separation.},
