abstract: Despite network monitoring and testing being critical for computer networks,
  current solutions are both extremely expensive and inflexible. Into this lacuna
  we launch the Open Source Network Tester, a fully open source traffic generator
  and capture system. Our prototype implementation on the NetFPGA-10G supports 4 ×
  10 Gb/s traffic generation across all packet sizes, and traffic capture is supported
  up to 2 × 10Gb/s with naïve host software. Our system implementation provides methods
  for scaling and coordinating multiple generator/capture systems, and supports 6.25
  ns timestamp resolution with clock drift and phase coordination maintained by GPS
  input. Additionally, our approach has demonstrated lower-cost than comparable commercial
  systems while achieving comparable levels of precision and accuracy; all within
  an open-source framework extensible with new features to support new applications,
  while permitting validation and review of the implementation.
