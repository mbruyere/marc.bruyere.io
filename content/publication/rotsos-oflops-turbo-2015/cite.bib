 abstract = {The heterogeneity barrier breakthrough achieved by the OpenFlow protocol is currently paced by the variability in performance semantics among network devices, which reduces the ability of applications to take complete advantage of programmable control. As a result, control applications remain conservative on performance requirements in order to be generalizable and trade performance for explicit state consistency in order to support varying performance behaviours. In this paper we argue that network control must be optimized towards network device capabilities and network managers and application developers must perform informed design decision using accurate switch performance proﬁles. This becomes highly critical for modern OpenFlow-enabled 10 GbE optical switches which signiﬁcantly elevate switch performance requirements. We present OFLOPS-Turbo, the integration of the OFLOPS switch evaluation platform, with the OSNT platform, a hardware-accelerated trafﬁc generation and capture system supporting lossless 10 GbE functionality. Using OFLOPS-Turbo, we conduct an evaluation of ﬂow table manipulation capabilities in a representative collection of 10 GbE production OpenFlow switch devices and interpret the evolution of OpenFlow support by comparison with historical data.},
