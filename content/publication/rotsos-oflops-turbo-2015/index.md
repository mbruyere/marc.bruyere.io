abstract: The heterogeneity barrier breakthrough achieved by the OpenFlow protocol
  is currently paced by the variability in performance semantics among network devices,
  which reduces the ability of applications to take complete advantage of programmable
  control. As a result, control applications remain conservative on performance requirements
  in order to be generalizable and trade performance for explicit state consistency
  in order to support varying performance behaviours. In this paper we argue that
  network control must be optimized towards network device capabilities and network
  managers and application developers must perform informed design decision using
  accurate switch performance proﬁles. This becomes highly critical for modern OpenFlow-enabled
  10 GbE optical switches which signiﬁcantly elevate switch performance requirements.
  We present OFLOPS-Turbo, the integration of the OFLOPS switch evaluation platform,
  with the OSNT platform, a hardware-accelerated trafﬁc generation and capture system
  supporting lossless 10 GbE functionality. Using OFLOPS-Turbo, we conduct an evaluation
  of ﬂow table manipulation capabilities in a representative collection of 10 GbE
  production OpenFlow switch devices and interpret the evolution of OpenFlow support
  by comparison with historical data.
