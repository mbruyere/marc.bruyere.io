abstract: The deployment experience of OpenFlow support in production networks has
  highlighted variable limitations between network devices and vendors, while the
  recent integration of OpenFlow control abstractions in 10 GbE switches, increases
  further the performance requirements to support the switch control plane. This paper
  presents OFLOPS-Turbo, an effort to integrate OFLOPS, the OpenFlow switch evaluation
  platform, with OSNT, a hardwareaccelerated trafÔ¨Åc generation and capture system.
