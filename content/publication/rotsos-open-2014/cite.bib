 abstract = {The deployment experience of OpenFlow support in production networks has highlighted variable limitations between network devices and vendors, while the recent integration of OpenFlow control abstractions in 10 GbE switches, increases further the performance requirements to support the switch control plane. This paper presents OFLOPS-Turbo, an effort to integrate OFLOPS, the OpenFlow switch evaluation platform, with OSNT, a hardwareaccelerated trafÔ¨Åc generation and capture system.},
