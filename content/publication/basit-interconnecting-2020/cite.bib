 abstract = {A recent trend of peering at geo-diversiﬁed Internet exchange points (IXPs) has empowered decades-old proposal of internetworking and opened up new avenues of business ventures. IP-transit, cloud direct and remote peering are a few important amongst numerous proposals of service provisioning capitalizing on this peering infrastructure support across domains. Enduring these business proposals becomes a challenging task, especially when the increased dependency of enterprises over the Internet is afﬁrmed. Volatile trafﬁc priorities necessitate different strategies of ﬂow management for each pattern of enterprise trafﬁc. Providing diverse service guarantees to each trafﬁc class require careful selection of resource allocation and compliance of inter-domain policies. In this paper, we propose a novel orchestration framework that helps to stitch end-to-end trafﬁc engineering compliant multiple paths. The framework enables prioritized management of various trafﬁc classes in a centralized manner by employing software deﬁned networking paradigm. Abstraction of multi-graph from the inter-connectivity of peering anchors helps to gear service provisioning spanning across multiple domains. Beside presenting details of our framework, we have articulated use cases highlighting the efﬁcacy of our proposal. We have observed a maximum increase of 26.52% in throughput using proposed model compared with an optimization formulation from literature. Our results imply transparent utility of this formulation for various network topologies and trafﬁc loads.},
