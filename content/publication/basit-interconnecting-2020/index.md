abstract: A recent trend of peering at geo-diversiﬁed Internet exchange points (IXPs)
  has empowered decades-old proposal of internetworking and opened up new avenues
  of business ventures. IP-transit, cloud direct and remote peering are a few important
  amongst numerous proposals of service provisioning capitalizing on this peering
  infrastructure support across domains. Enduring these business proposals becomes
  a challenging task, especially when the increased dependency of enterprises over
  the Internet is afﬁrmed. Volatile trafﬁc priorities necessitate different strategies
  of ﬂow management for each pattern of enterprise trafﬁc. Providing diverse service
  guarantees to each trafﬁc class require careful selection of resource allocation
  and compliance of inter-domain policies. In this paper, we propose a novel orchestration
  framework that helps to stitch end-to-end trafﬁc engineering compliant multiple
  paths. The framework enables prioritized management of various trafﬁc classes in
  a centralized manner by employing software deﬁned networking paradigm. Abstraction
  of multi-graph from the inter-connectivity of peering anchors helps to gear service
  provisioning spanning across multiple domains. Beside presenting details of our
  framework, we have articulated use cases highlighting the efﬁcacy of our proposal.
  We have observed a maximum increase of 26.52% in throughput using proposed model
  compared with an optimization formulation from literature. Our results imply transparent
  utility of this formulation for various network topologies and trafﬁc loads.
