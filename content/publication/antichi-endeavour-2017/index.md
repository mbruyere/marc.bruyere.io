abstract: 'Innovation in interdomain routing has remained stagnant for over a decade.
  Recently, IXPs have emerged as economically-advantageous interconnection points
  for reducing path latencies and exchanging ever increasing traffic volumes among,
  possibly, hundreds of networks. Given their far-reaching implications on interdomain
  routing, IXPs are the ideal place to foster network innovation and extend the benefits
  of SDN to the interdomain level. In this paper, we present, evaluate, and demonstrate
  ENDEAVOUR, an SDN platform for IXPs. ENDEAVOUR can be deployed on a multi-hop IXP
  fabric, supports a large number of use cases, and is highly-scalable while avoiding
  broadcast storms. Our evaluation with real data from one of the largest IXPs, demonstrates
  the benefits and scalability of our solution: ENDEAVOUR requires around 70% fewer
  rules than alternative SDN solutions thanks to our rule partitioning mechanism.
  In addition, by providing an open source solution, we invite everyone from the community
  to experiment (and improve) our implementation as well as adapt it to new use cases.'
