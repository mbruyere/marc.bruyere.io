abstract: 'Over the past decade, IXPs have been playing a key role in enabling interdomain
  connectivity. Their traffic volumes have quickly become similar to those of Tier-1
  ASes and their physical presence has spread across the world. While the relevance
  of IXPs is undeniable, their contribution to the shaping of the current Internet
  is not fully understood yet, especially on the so-called “flattening” phenomenon.
  In this paper, we disentangle “flattening” from “path shortening”: we show that
  the impact of IXPs on path-length is limited. Surprisingly, Internet path-lengths
  have globally barely decreased over the last decade, regardless of whether they
  cross IXPs or not. Instead of a “path-shortening”, we observe a diversion of the
  routes away from the central Tier-1 ASes, supported by IXPs. This diversion has
  however not fundamentally changed the existence of a hierarchy, but rather replaced
  the central Tier-1s with a new set of players.'
