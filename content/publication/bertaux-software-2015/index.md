abstract: Satellite networks have traditionally been considered for specific purposes.
  Recently, new satellite technologies have been pushed to the market enabling highperformance
  satellite access networks. On the other hand, network architectures are taking advantages
  from emerging technologies such as Software-Defined Networking (SDN), network virtualization
  and Network Functions Virtualization (NFV). Therefore, benefiting communications
  services over satellite networks from these new technologies at first, and their
  seamless integration with terrestrial networks at second, are of great interest
  and importance. In this paper, and through comprehensive use cases, the advantages
  of introducing network programmability and virtualization using SDN and/or NFV in
  satellite networks are investigated. The requirements to be fulfilled in each use
  case are also discussed.
