 abstract = {Satellite networks have traditionally been considered for specific purposes. Recently, new satellite technologies have been pushed to the market enabling highperformance satellite access networks. On the other hand, network architectures are taking advantages from emerging technologies such as Software-Defined Networking (SDN), network virtualization and Network Functions Virtualization (NFV). Therefore, benefiting communications services over satellite networks from these new technologies at first, and their seamless integration with terrestrial networks at second, are of great interest and importance. In this paper, and through comprehensive use cases, the advantages of introducing network programmability and virtualization using SDN and/or NFV in satellite networks are investigated. The requirements to be fulfilled in each use case are also discussed.},
