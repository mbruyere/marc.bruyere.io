abstract: The task of determining which network architectures provide the best ratio
  in terms of operation and management efforts vs. performance guarantees is not trivial.
  In this paper, we investigate the complexity of operating different types of architectures
  from the perspective of the space of network parameters that need to be monitored
  and conﬁgured. We present OPLEX, a novel framework based on the analysis of YANG
  data models of network implementations that enables operators to compare architecture
  options based on the dimension of the parameter space. We implement OPLEX as part
  of an operatorfriendly tool that can be used to determine the space associated with
  an architecture in an automatic and ﬂexible way. The beneﬁts of the proposed framework
  are demonstrated in the use case of Internet Exchange Point (IXP) network architectures,
  for which we take advantage of the rich set of publicly available data. We also
  exploit the results of a survey and direct consultations we conducted with operators
  and vendors of IXPs on their perception of complexity when operating different architectures.
  OPLEX is ﬂexible, builds upon data models with widespread usage in the community,
  and provides a practical solution geared towards operators for characterizing the
  complexity of network architecture options.
