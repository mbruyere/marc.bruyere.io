 abstract = {Abstract—Software Deﬁned Internet eXchange Points (SDXs) are a promising solution to the long-standing limitations and problems of interdomain routing. While proposed SDX architectures have improved the scalability of the control plane, these solutions have ignored the underlying fabric upon which they should be deployed. In this paper, we present Umbrella, a software deﬁned interconnection fabric that complements and enhances those architectures.},
