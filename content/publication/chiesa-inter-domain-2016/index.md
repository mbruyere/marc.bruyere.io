abstract: While innovation in inter-domain routing has remained stagnant for over
  a decade, Internet exchange points (IXPs) are consolidating their role as economically
  advantageous interconnection points for reducing path latencies and exchanging ever
  increasing amounts of traffic. As such, IXPs appear as a natural place to foster
  network innovation and assess the benefits of SDN, a recent technological trend
  that has already boosted innovation within data center networks. In this article,
  we give a comprehensive overview of use cases for SDN at IXPs, which leverage the
  superior vantage point of an IXP to introduce advanced features like load balancing
  and DDoS mitigation. We discuss the benefits of SDN solutions by analyzing real-world
  data from one of the largest IXPs. We also leverage insights into IXP operations
  to shape benefits not only for members but also for operators.
