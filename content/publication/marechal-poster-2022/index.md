abstract: 'In a nutshell, Segment Routing (Sr) is a loose source routing paradigm
  based on an ordered list of segments (i.e., one or more forwarding instructions).
  Over the years, Sr has found a suitable usage in network monitoring, traffic engineering,
  or failure recovery, among others. Two forwarding plane encapsulations are proposed
  for Sr: MPLS (the focus of this extended abstract – Sr-Mpls) and Extension Headers
  for IPv6 (Srv6). Srv6 deployment in the Internet has been investigated by [7]. To
  the best of our knowledge, this extended abstract is the first attempt in revealing
  the deployment and usage of Sr-Mpls in the wild. Early results suggest that Sr-Mpls
  is mainly used in interworking with classic MPLS tunnels in Vodafone.'
