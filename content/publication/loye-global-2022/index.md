abstract: A massive and growing part of Autonomous System (AS)-level traffic exchanges
  takes place at Internet Exchange Points (IXPs). This paper leverages PeeringDB,
  a database providing a partial but reasonable view of the global interconnection
  of ASes at IXPs, to model a complex graph enabling the characterization of the key
  Internet peering players and their interactions over time. We model a PeeringDB
  snapshot as a weighted directed bipartite graph, called the pDB c-graph, that captures
  the port size ASes possess at IXPs using available metadata. This novel model of
  the Internet is shown to picture relevant features of a complex network that groups
  ASes and IXPs in geographical areas of influence. From this model, we extract central
  players of public peering such as hypergiant AS content providers and major regional
  traffic receivers. Most importantly, this graph model opens the way to apply spectral
  analysis using reduced Google matrix in order to retrieve the intensity of possible
  interactions between ASes on the basis of pure connectivity information. As an illustration,
  we retrieve the timely evolution of the peering network to show how the central
  content and cloud providers have increased their reach to eyeball networks during
  Covid-19 pandemic.
