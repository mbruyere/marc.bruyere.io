Computer networks are pervasive critical infrastructure, with artifacts informed by networking research, ranging from cell phones to data centers, impacting the lives of billions of people daily. Indeed, all networks involve humans in some way – either as end users, network operators, network planners, non-users, or myriad other ways in which humans are entangled with today’s Internet infrastructure. Recognizing the interaction between networks and humans as a first-class research focus can open fruitful lines of inquiry into important, long-standing and new questions facing the networking.
