I began my career back in 1996 with my first job at Club-Internet.fr and I am still evolving.

Over the years, I had the privilege of working with some exceptional organizations, including Cisco, Vivendi Universal, Credit Suisse First Boston, Airbus/Dimension Data, Force10 Networks, Dell - Force10, CNRS  and now Internet Initiative Japan.

One of my notable achievements is earning the title of **CCIE Emeritus #16656** and  I pursued later with a  **Ph.D. degree** at the LAAS CNRS, followed by a two-year PostDoc at the University of Tokyo on operational research topics. 

My doctoral thesis revolved around open-source OpenFlow and who ended with an  P4 SDN solutions for Internet Exchange Points (IXPs).

My recent Ph.D. work in advanced networking technologies has strengthened my expertise, particularly in designing and implementing full-stack network architectures for large-scale environments involving complex trade-offs.
