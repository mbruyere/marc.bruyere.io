Bringing over than two  decades of experience in advanced networking, I've contributed to industry giants like Cisco, Vivendi Universal, and Internet Initiative Japan Lab. 

A CCIE Emeritus and Ph.D. holder, my expertise spans innovative SDN solutions and impactful operational research. 

My work integrates academic rigor with real-world applicability, focusing on network architecture design for large-scale environments.

 I'm open to opportunities to apply my unique skill set in operational research, driving technological advancements and practical solutions.

<!-- My recent Ph.D. work in advanced networking technologies has strengthened my expertise, particularly in designing and implementing full-stack network architectures for large-scale environments involving complex trade-offs.
